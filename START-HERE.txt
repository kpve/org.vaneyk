 Getting started:

1) Install maven:
    
    http://maven.apache.org/download.html#Installation

2) Configure maven to use the expedia-central repository:

    NOTE: the user/password steps portion of the steps are only necessary if the expedia repositories are configured to require authentication.  While
          this may change in the future, they are currently only require authentication to deploy artifacts (read access is anonymous.) 

    a) Create a secure password:

       - copy settings-security.xml to [user home]/.m2/security-settings.xml
       - replace the [TOODO...] placeholders in this file with a master password hash by following maven's instructions: http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html
    
    b) Create a maven server configuration:

       - copy settings.xml to [user home]/.m2/settings.xml
       - replace the [TODO...] placeholders in this file with your user id and encrypted password by following maven's instructions: http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html

    c) Get the source code for your project and build:

       - git clone ....
       - cd project root
       - mvn validate
       - follow the instructions provided for the project :)  (the expedia standard is to provide build instructions/help when "mvn validate" is run)
