Getting Started Development Sandbox Instructions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Make sure your maven client is configured to point to expedia's repositories
   (settings.xml etc.)

2) cd target\[new\project\group\and\name\path]

   mvn clean package -Dstart-webapp

3) Confirm the web app is running by trying the index page:

   http://localhost:9090/
   
   Click on the standard jetty link to get to your app's welcome page:
   
   http://localhost:9090/[new project name]
   
4) cntrl-c in your shell to kill the jetty process running the web app.


Some Useful Maven Commands                 Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: All commands listed are intended to be run from the root of the project.
      If you are maven savvy you can look at the poms, use help:effective-pom
      etc. to run commands in child modules.  See the maven docs and plugin
      docs for more info.


mvn validate -N                            Validates the root maven project and is 
                                           a quick way to show the help menu (this).

mvn clean package                          Builds the application modules and 
                                           installs the application's external 
                                           resources to the standard corporate location
                                           just like in non-dev environments.
                                           
                                           The only exception is the war file
                                           is not copied because jetty runs it from
                                           your web module source files (this is
                                           for quicker dev cycles).  See commands
                                           below for how to actually install the 
                                           war file as well.  
                                       
                                           Look in /application/[app name] to 
                                           see the installed files.

mvn clean package -Dinstall-application    Same as previous command plus also 
                                           installs the application to the standard
                                           corporate location so it can be run
                                           by a container other than the maven jetty
                                           plugin.

mvn clean package -Dstart-webapp           Starts the web application as a daemon to
                                           the build process. The app's welcome page 
                                           is http://localhost:9090/[new project name]

mvn clean verify                           Builds and starts the web app, runs 
                                           integration tests and then shuts down 
                                           the web app.
                                       
mvn install -Ddependency-support           Copies project dependencies and creates
                                           dependency reports in all modules target
                                           directories.  Very helpful for debugging
                                           api issues with and generating legal
                                           requests for third party apis. 
                                       
                                           NOTE: application modules have dependencies
                                           on each other so its possible that this 
                                           command will fail for some modules if 
                                           other modules they depend have not been
                                           built yet or failed to build 
                                           (due to compilation errors for example.) 
                                       
General maven commands, plugins etc should work.  For more info take a look
at the corporate pom.
