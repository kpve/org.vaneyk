Instructions:

    1) Check out the archetype (assumed to be in location [archetype home] for
       the rest of the instructions.)
    
    2) Make sure your maven client is configured to point to expedia's repositories

    3) Run the archetype:

       cd [archetype home] 
       mvn clean package -Darchetype.new-project.maven-group-id=[group id] -Darchetype.new-project.name=[name]
       
       
       NOTE: The archetype depends on the corporate pom com.expedia:corporate-parent.
             If you have network connectivity to corporate-central this dependency
             will be downloaded to your local repository by maven automatically.
             If you do not have network connectivity to corporate-central you can
             check out corporate pom project and build it locally to get it into
             your local repository.

    4) Start using the new project:
    
       copy [archetype home]\target\myProjectName [myWorkspace]\myProjectName       
       cd [myWorkspace]\myProjectName
       mvn validate -Dhelp
       
    5) Follow the help instructions for the new project, that's it :)
